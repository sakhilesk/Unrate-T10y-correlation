# Analysis: Unemployment Rate vs 10-Year Treasury Yield Curve (1975-2023)

## Overview
This report analyzes the relationship between the U.S. unemployment rate (UNRATE) and the 10-year Treasury yield curve (T10Y2Y) from approximately 1975 to 2023, with a focus on their behavior during economic recessions.

## Correlation
- The graph indicates a correlation of 0.44 between UNRATE and T10Y2Y.
- R-squared value is 0.19, suggesting that 19% of the variance in one variable can be explained by the other.

## General Trends
1. UNRATE (blue line):
   - Fluctuates more widely, ranging from about 3.5% to 15%.
   - Shows cyclical patterns, with peaks often corresponding to recession periods.

2. T10Y2Y (orange line):
   - Generally fluctuates between -0.5 and 3, with occasional dips below 0 (inverted yield curve).
   - Shows less dramatic fluctuations compared to UNRATE.

## Recession Analysis
While specific recession dates aren't marked, we can infer them from significant UNRATE spikes:

1. Early 1980s Recession:
   - UNRATE: Sharp increase to around 10%.
   - T10Y2Y: Volatile, with a significant drop to negative values.

2. Early 1990s Recession:
   - UNRATE: Increase to about 7.5%.
   - T10Y2Y: Decline followed by a sharp rise.

3. Dot-com Bubble (Early 2000s):
   - UNRATE: Moderate increase to about 6%.
   - T10Y2Y: Decline to near 0, then a sharp rise.

4. Great Recession (2008-2009):
   - UNRATE: Dramatic spike to 10%.
   - T10Y2Y: Sharp decline followed by a rapid increase.

5. COVID-19 Pandemic (2020):
   - UNRATE: Unprecedented spike to nearly 15%.
   - T10Y2Y: Sharp drop to negative values.

## Key Observations
1. Inverted Yield Curve: T10Y2Y often turns negative (inverted yield curve) shortly before or during recessions, potentially serving as a recession indicator.

2. Unemployment Lag: UNRATE typically peaks during or slightly after recessions, reflecting the delayed impact on the job market.

3. Recovery Patterns: Post-recession, UNRATE tends to decline gradually, while T10Y2Y often shows a quicker recovery or even a sharp increase.

4. Varying Intensity: The magnitude of UNRATE increases differs across recessions, with the 2020 pandemic causing the most dramatic spike.

5. Long-term Trends: There's a general downward trend in both UNRATE and T10Y2Y from the 1980s to 2020, possibly reflecting changing economic structures and monetary policies.

## Conclusion
The relationship between unemployment and the yield curve is complex, with moderate positive correlation. While both react to economic downturns, the yield curve (T10Y2Y) often serves as a leading indicator, inverting before recessions, while unemployment (UNRATE) typically lags, peaking during or after recessions. This analysis underscores the importance of considering both indicators for a comprehensive view of economic health and potential downturns.
